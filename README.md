# stock-stalker
WIP. An experiment with pupeteer and pattern recognition...

// start by getting the reporter working
// twilio and mongo integration?
// then think about "diffing engine" for intelligent trades
// is there a free stock trading api?
// use dependency injection in trade DSL for different platforms - could this be a platform for others to use?
// most traded stocks? aggregate ALL trades across ALL games via web crawling?

* TODO
* dynamic player selection (or, input player)
