# stock-stalker
WIP. An experiment with pupeteer and pattern recognition...


# Ideas
* twilio integration
* re-write using pure scraping w/o headless chrome - will improve performance
* most traded stocks? aggregate ALL trades across ALL games via web crawling?

* think about portfolio matching system - can analyze holdings statically, actually

* is there a free stock trading api?
* use dependency injection in trade DSL for different platforms - could this be a platform for others to use?

# TODO
* dynamic player selection (or, input player)
