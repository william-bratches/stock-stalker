# stock-stalker
WIP. An experiment with pupeteer and pattern recognition...


# Ideas
* NOW ON: building differ and poller to tell when trade has happened
* twilio and mongo integration? // TODO

* then think about "diffing engine" for intelligent trades/portfolio matching
* is there a free stock trading api?
* use dependency injection in trade DSL for different platforms - could this be a platform for others to use?
* most traded stocks? aggregate ALL trades across ALL games via web crawling?

# TODO
* dynamic player selection (or, input player)
